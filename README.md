**Arvostelu** is a service for managing reviews and comments. It's intended 
as a lightweight extension of existing services to save the re-write of 
review / commenting features, or the extraneous use of heavy and comprehensive
solutions that don't integrate as well into microservice architecture.

## Origin

The name **Arvostelu** comes from the Finnish for **review**, **judgement**, 
and **criticism**.
